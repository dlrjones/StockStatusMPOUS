// Email Password
/*
The password for the SendMail portion of this app is stored in the file [outFilePath]\status.txt (find outFilePath in the config file).
The referenced library KeyMaster is used to decrypt the password at run time. There is another app called EncryptAndHash 
(found in \\Lapis\h_purchasing$\Purchasing\PMM IS data\HEMM Apps\Executables\ ) that you can use to change the password when that becomes necessary. The key is pmmhelp.
